- title: Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite (& Beyond)
  platform: PC
  text: I always liked this game for what it was, the mod improved the worst part: the visuals. But its very much the same game underneath, love it or hate it, i enjoyed playing it for a short while. 


- title: The Legend Of Bumbo
  platform: PC
  text: Love the style, love the humour, gameplay is fun but quickly got boring. I like solving each tilesheet and trying to get the optimal plays each turn but other than that one itch, the game has little else going for it.

- title: Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War
  platform: PC 
  text: Pleasantly surprised but this compelling wee RTS game, the first RTS ive played more than 2 missions into and had a great time. Captures the large scale of warhammer battles well and its cool seeing all the different races interact.
