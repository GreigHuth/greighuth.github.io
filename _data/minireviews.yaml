  text: WOW. This game is elegant, thoughtful and compelling. A game that feels like it really took 10 years to design and perfect. Ive never been so happy to formulate a plan and execute it, and when i finally worked out what to do it felt so perfect as it all fell into place. Go play this.

  text: Only finished playing FFI at the moment. Had this game all my life and have only now just finished it. Short, easy, but cathartic and somewhat satisfying. Good to see that Final Fantasy has been relying on tropes since day 1.

  text: I have wanted one of these my whole life, and it does feel good to finally use one. Since before the switch i have loved the concept of games you can play on your TV and carry around with you. Games look good and you can choose different borders but there arent really any features other than "Play Game Boy games on your TV" but thats enough for me for now.
