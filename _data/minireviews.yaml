- title: Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite (& Beyond)
  platform: PC
  text: I always liked this game for what it was, the mod improved the worst part, the visuals. But its very much the same game underneath, love it or hate it, i enjoyed playing it for a short while. 
  
- title: The Legend Of Bumbo
  platform: PC
  text: Love the style, love the humour, gameplay is fun but quickly got boring. I like solving each tilesheet and trying to get the optimal plays each turn but other than that one itch, the game has little else going for it.
  
- title: Pok√©mon: Emerald
  platform: GBA
  text: Its pokemon and its good, the climax with Rayquaza marks a big step forward in the story telling and mythology in pokemon. I liked the frequency of double battles. Will update once i get around to the battle frontier.

- title: Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War
  platform: PC 
  text: Pleasantly surprised but this compelling wee RTS game, the first RTS ive played more than 2 missions into and had a great time. Captures the large scale of warhammer battles well and its cool seeing all the different races interact.
