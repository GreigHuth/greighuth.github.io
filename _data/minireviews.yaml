  text: WOW. This game is elegant, thoughtful and compelling. A game that feels like it really took 10 years to design and perfect. Ive never been so happy to formulate a plan and execute it, and when i finally worked out what to do it felt so perfect as it all fell into place. Go play this.

  text: Only finished playing FFI at the moment. Had this game all my life and have only now just finished it. Short, easy, but cathartic and somewhat satisfying. Good to see that Final Fantasy has been relying on tropes since day 1.
