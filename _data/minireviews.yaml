- title: Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite (& Beyond)
  platform: PC
  text: I always liked this game for what it was, the mod improved the worst part, the visuals. But its very much the same game underneath, love it or hate it, i enjoyed playing it for a short while. 
  
- title: The Legend Of Bumbo
  platform: PC
  text: Love the style, love the humour, gameplay is fun but quickly got boring. I like solving each tilesheet and trying to get the optimal plays each turn but other than that one itch, the game has little else going for it.

- title: Mega Man X Command Mission
  platform: GC
  text: Only played about 3 hours of this. I like Xs scarf, that the nicest thing i have to say about it.
  
- title: Pokémon Emerald
  platform: GBA
  text: Its pokemon and its good, the climax with Rayquaza marks a big step forward in the story telling and mythology in pokemon. I liked the frequency of double battles. Will update once i get around to the battle frontier.

- title: Warhammer 40,000 Dawn Of War
  platform: PC 
  text: Pleasantly surprised but this compelling wee RTS game, the first RTS ive played more than 2 missions into and had a great time. Captures the large scale of warhammer battles well and its cool seeing all the different races interact.

- title: Lunacid  
  platform: PC
  text: Yeah, i dont really know what to say. Its a modernisation of classic dungeon crawlers. Pretty much everything about the combat sucks, but it kept me interested with its levels. Despite the dour tone its a surprisingly comfortable game.
