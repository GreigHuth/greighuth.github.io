---Intro/Explaining the shows popularity?

You probably thought that, given my background, my first real blog post ought to be about something techy. You are wrong, because i want to write about how fucking shit Friends is despite its insane popularity. As im sure you know, the show was an absolute phenomenon throughtout the 90s and into the early 00s. Its a kind of popularity that transcended simply enjoying the show. Swathes of merchanidse litter bargain bins and poundland gift sections. I dont think it is physically possible to walk into a charity shop and not be greeted by at least a boxset or two. Thats not even talking about the reruns. The show was ran for years after its final episode, constantly occupying the daytime slots of channel 4 and its derivatives. Its one of those shows that most people have seen an episode of, and if you havent you are probably making a point not to. 

So now comes the question "But Why?". Well, I think id like to have a stab at explaining why, and why i think it shouldnt be and why its shit and bad and the worst thing ever, total unredeemable and the writers probably eat squirrels.






Its a cornerstone of popular culture, some see it as a heartwarming show with colourful, lovable characters. I do not agree with this :). 


---talk about the show and why people like it


---talk about why i started watching it, and why i watched (almost) every episode, and why i want to write a shitty blog post about it 

---what i learned (spoiler, its a fucking awful show that really isnt that funny or clever, and infact perpotrates and propogates problematic behaviour typical to the ambivalent white middle class of america)
