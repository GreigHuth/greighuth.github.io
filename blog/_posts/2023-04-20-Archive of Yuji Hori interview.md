Copied verbatim from issue 58 of The Official Nintendo Magazine UK, published by Future plc in August 2010 for your local newsagents.

# START OF TEXT

### Feature: Enter the Dragon

### ONM Travels to Tokyo to meet the fathers of Dragon Quest and find out how the 24-year-old series is gearing up for the 21st century.

When invited on a press trip, __ONM__ is pure business. Armed with business cards, dictaphone and ten pages of probing questions, we stride into Square-Enix's Tokyo HQ ready to give Team *Dragon Quest* the grilling of their lives. Turns out they want to talk about a grilling of thier own, specially beef. Yes, we're sitting face to face wih the geniuses behind games that have sold 53 million copies to date and we're talking about beef. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding to be precise. Koichi Sugiyama, the series' composer, says the dish is a favourite of his, last eaten when he came to the UK to record an album with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. At 79 years old - a rare age in this relatively young industry - he is sprightly and mischevious. He can talk meats all day.

Of course, we've got more to discuss than the pros and cons of Aunt Bessie's puds. To Sugiyama's right is series creator Yuji Horii, 24 years younger but still one of Japan's most revered gaming elders. As creator, designer and writerm Horii is the daddy of *Dragon Quest*. It's evident from the gaggle of Square-Enix underlings sitting around the edge of the room, hanging on his every word. Even Ryutaro Ichimura, producer of *Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies*, seems in awe . During our interview he defers reverentially to the creator; ince Horii has spoken there is nothing more to be said. Hey, 53 million sales will earn you that kind of respect. We're here to find out how Horii and his friends intend to increase that figure in the west.

### The Start Of Something

*Dragon Quest IX* is the subject of day, but before we start we ask Horii what he considers to be the essence of *Dragon Quest*, the fundamental idea that has powered 24 years of role-playing success

>*"As an overview, an RPG in my terms is 'you are the hero'. You're in there and you experience the story first hand"*

He explains.

>*"These are games where i believe you you should get the CD or whatever it is, stick it in the console immediately - don't read the manual, don't touch that manual. Just go in, pick up that controller and press buttons and see what happens. For me, and RPG is something you figure out very quickly, its very welcoming, very accessible, without looking at a manual."*

Much of *Dragon Quest's* accessibility stems from recognition. Over the nine games (as well as 40 ports, remakes and spin-offs) certain visual and audio motifs have remained unchanged. Think of the churches where you save or the parping jingle that plays upon levelling up. They offer us soothing familiarity - and Horii agrees.

>*"It's basically to give the person playing a feel of ease. You're playing a different game but you feel at ease because you just saved your game and you know its because you heard that sound and its evocative of the sound you heard before. Just that little tune alone, that you've saved your game, will reduce the pulse."*


Sugiyama - who compose many of the game's first jingles way back in 1986 - sees his ditties as part of a *Dragon Quest* "language". He explains that

>*"on the one side you have the music composing and the score,then you've got the sound effects which are, effectively, puncuation in the game. And that's something that is a direct signal to the player. You're in a church, you've saved your game, its okay. Or you've levelled up, well done!"*

Can they ever be changed? Or is there a secret *Quest* rulebook to be obeyed? Sugiyama points to a nearby stuffed Slime. 

>*"If you see that thing, then you know you're in Dragon Quest. And when you turn it on you've got the Dragon Quest march theme song, and that unmistakeably takes you off to Dragon Quest."*

That sounds like a 'no' to any changes then.

## The Art Of The Matter

Talking of Slimes, there is one key figure missing from our interview panel: acclaimed manga artist (and Dragon Ball creator) Akira Toriyama. Responsible for character and monster design - and all that cosplay-resistant angular hair - he is the final member of the Holy *Dragon Quest* trinity. Horii, Sugiyama and Toriyama were there from the start. We joke that the new character creation aspect of *Dragon Quest IX* has put Toriyama out of a job. There are stern faces all around and a quick rebuttal from Ichimura.

>*"Quite the opposite! Mr Toriyama is responsible for everything you see in the game, so for him it was an enourmous job."*

Okay, no more jokes

If the music, art and accessibility are the untouchable elements of *Dragon Quest IX*. He tells us that the host platform played a big part.

>*"With IX, because it was on the DS it was very clear that the key element this time would be multiplayer and Tag Mode,"*


He explains.

>*"There would be a bridge between people playing the game, something to connect people."*

We find it interesting that the first  thing that comes to Horii's mind is the multiplayer - while Wi-Fi is at the heart of many of the best DS games, we wouldn't exactly call it the handheld's trump card. But as it turns out, Horii's opinion of the device is shaped by another __ONM__ favourite. 

>*"I enjoyed the very polished multiplayer aspect in Animal Crossing on the DS,"*

he reveals.

## A New Beginning

Although we've killed Slimes on DS before - thanks to the excellent ports of *Quests IV* and *V* - this is the first *Quest* designed afresh for the handheld. Considering the last game was on the technically superior Playstation 2, how hard was it to get thier heads around a less powerful device? Ichimura is refreshingly  frank about the task. 

>*"It was the mother of all challenges. We joked that when we were designing for the DS that it was like going back in time. We were fighting memory issues again. 'You remember the old days?' We did say that."*

Not that the team didn't manage it, of course.

>*"We're very happy. We overcame all the challenges."*

he says.

And a spare thought for the poor composer Sugiyama. Having previously written a fully orchestral PS2 soundtrack, he found himself with a one-way ticket back to MIDI-Land. He took it with good humour.

>*"Yes, I had to go the DS and there wasn't any full orchestra any more,"*

he says. 

>*"But when i put together a score I'm thinking orchestrally, I'm thinking full symphony orchestra. I'll pull out of the DS whatever is possible to evoke that in the person playing the game. You'll be hearing MIDI noise, butmy aim is to give you the feeling you're listening to a full orchestra."*

Showing how in tune (sorry) he is with *IX's* epic scope. Sugiyama adds that

>*"me trying to get that out of the DS is my quest, my adventure!"

To the team's credit, *Dragon Quest IX"* is a technical marvel. But, perhaps more interesting is how Horii balances the epic sweep expected from a *Dragon Quest* with the portable nature of the DS. This is, after all, the first *Quest* not designed to be played at home in long stretches -

>*"you're not tied to the TV or monitor"*

says Horii. He seems to have relished the opportunity. 

>*"You can take it out on the street or bus or train, its's light and easygoing. You can play five minutes or you can play five hours straight, its up to you. If there are gaps in the day when you fel like playing you can do that. We've had feedback from people who have played two, three, 400 hours and they don't feel like 'God, I've played this game for ages', they feel like 'oh, i just dipped in and out of it' and then 'oh my goodness, i played 300 hours'."*

Having lost several weeks to our office copy, it's all too easy to believe.

## Telling The Story

As he's the writer, we're also curious to find out from Horii how he crafts a portable tale. It's built from lots of mini, time-friendly story arcs (you collect seven mystical fruits, each with its own problematic scenario), and we're surprised to hear this is more down to technical limitations than anything else.

>*"It's not so much something that has come about because 'oh it's the DS this is a way to tell a story'."*

he explains.

>*"There are limitations on memory and what can be processed at one time. [The story's] more of a resut of that."

Thats's us told. No more Newsnight Review over-analysing for __ONM__, then. Undeterred, we continue to probe.
