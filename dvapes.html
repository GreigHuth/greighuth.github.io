    <p>I hate disposable vapes. </p>

    <p>I hate them because people carelessly discard them in the street and gutter.</p>
    
    
    <p>I hate that we mine and exploit countries like Chile and Austrailia for preciously finite Lithium in order to build these shitty vaporisers that end up in a bin.</p>

    <p>I hate them because the people that make them and the people that sell them take advantage of kids to sell them disgustingly addicitive products they dont understand.</p>

    <p>I hate them because they dont actually help people stop smoking. The adults that buy them either never smoked or just replace thier addiction with something else, and more than half of kids in England that vaped tried that 
    before trying cigarettes, if at all [1].</p>
    
    <p>I hate them so much that I couldnt fucking stand it anymore so I went outside, picked some up, took some photos, made this shitty web page and wrote these words right now to express the deep frustration screaming at me 
    constantly asking "WHY CANT OTHER PEOPLE SEE THIS".</p>
    
    <p>So here is the work in progress result of that. If you want to get in touch email me.</p>
