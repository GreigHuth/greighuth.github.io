<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHO ARE YOU?</h2>
<p>
As i said, i am Greig and this is my website. I do many things, but mostly i play video games and fiddle with computers.
I've been in and out of a couple jobs since graduating from university and decided i really need to get myself one of those 
fancy BlogsTM that are so popular. 
My love of games has motivated me to pursue game design and development so the main purpose of this site is to have a 
portfolio i can whap out when i need to. 
I live in Scotland, i may also have been born here but my memory of that event is mysteriously hazy.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY DO?</h2>

<p>
My current job is doing IT/System Admin/Random Things at <a href="https://smartr.ai"> smartR.ai</a>. Its a few hours of
contract work a week usually involving me fiddling with OCI containters or resetting passwords or uninstalling windows :).
</p>

I went to the University Of Edinburgh for computer science and graduated in 2021. To put it simply i enjoy learning about how
things work and my love of games naturally steered me to pursue computing as a profession. My degree gave me a good grasp of 
the fundamentals, and it has lead me to my next goal, game development.

But that hasnt happened. Basically video games are the thing im best at, what ever that means so im doing something about it, bookmark it.

The video games I'm saying are my favourite (for the moment) are:
Final Fantasy X (2001) - Playstation 2
Death Stranding - (2019) - Playstation 4
Dark Souls (2011) - Xbox 360 / Playstation 3 / PC

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR?</h2>
<p>
I care a lot about social issues, im not going to list them all here but in particular i care about internet privacy,
and the environment.
