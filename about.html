<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHO ARE YOU?</h2>
<p>
I am Greig and this is my website/blog. I am many things but mostly I am someone who likes video games. The interactive moving picture contests we call 
Video Games tee-em are 

My love of games has motivated me to pursue game design, discussion and development so the main purpose of this site is to have a portfolio i can 
whap out when I need to. I love video games, and i want to share how great I think they are with people. There is definitely no shortage
of us but that isn't going to stop me. 
I live in Scotland, i may also have been born here but my memory of that event is mysteriously hazy.

    My favourite games at the moment in no particular order are:

<ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><i>Sin and Punishment</i> (2000) - Nintendo 64</li>
    <li><i>Final Fantasy X</i> (2001) - Sony Playstation 2 </li>
    <li><i>Dark Souls</i> (2011) - Xbox 360/Sony Playstation 3/PC </li>
    <li><i>Death Stranding</i> (2019) - Sony Playstation 4 </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY DO?</h2>
<p>
In the past I've worked professionally: in a law firm, in the kitchen of one of the busiest restaurants on the royal mile, as a University Tutor,
  
My current method of making the ends meet is doing System Administration <a href="https://smartr.ai"> smartR.ai</a>. It's a few hours of contract work each week
usually involving a screen and a keyboard.
</p>

<p>
As previously mentioned i want to write about video games. I've been playing them almost as long as my memories exist and i feel like ive spent so much of the 
most recent years of my life trying to forget them...


But now, faced with the rest of my life, ive decided i want to spend this part of it understanding why they enamour and inspire me. This website
