<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHO ARE YOU?</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><i>Ostensibly not a graphic designer</i></h5>

<p style="clear:left;"> 
I am Greig and this is my website/blog.
I studied Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh, and after being dissatisfied with almost every job Ive had, Ive decided to focus on being happy rather than being
"successful". I am many things but mostly I am someone who likes video games and wants to make video games. 
I love video games for a few simple reasons:
they are incredible cathartic,
i love learning and they reward curiosity and mastery,
and their potential to evoke empathy is (in my opinion) unparalleled.

I enjoy games from literally <i>all</i> gaming genres, but i mostly play: 3rd Person "find and fight" games, platformers', Non-Western RPGs and fighting games.
</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY DO?</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><i>Piss and Whinge, but sometimes constructively</i> </h5>

<p>
In the past I've worked as: 
An admin assistant at a law firm, 
a kitchen porter in a busy and toxic high street restaurant, 
as the only technically competent individual in a growing e-commerce startup,
and as a tutor in one of the most prestigious, oldest and highest performing universities in the great county of Midlothian.
My most recent job has been doing System Administration @ <a href="https://smartr.ai"> smartR.ai</a>.
This work has included an assortment of jobs ranging from: tech support, buying company hardware, containerizing and deploying essential company services and cleaning up messes.
</p>

<p>
As previously mentioned I want to make video games and that has been my primary pursuit since university.
Ive been slowly but surely developing my skills ranging from 3D modelling and modding to gameplay system and graphics programming
and gained some experience with a few SDKs and engines (Pico-8, Playdate SDK, Unity) but its hard to maintain momentum. My progress is taking time but thats 
    fine because im not in a rush.
In my opinion developing games requires not only technical prowess and a good idea, but a deep love of games, and an understanding of the potential of the fledgling art form. 
To me this involves playing, watching, analysing and experimenting with; a lot of video games. I don't just enjoy playing games, I take time to think about why im 
enjoying what im doing right now, and often have more fun discussing the game then actually playing it.
Some of these ruminations can be found on this website, but some remain unpublished until they develop into more coherent prose.
So yes i play a lot of games, in fact you can see a  <a href="/everygameiveplayed.txt"> complete list of every game ive played an hour of</a>, but recently 
I've been playing:

<p>
As well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw">interactive-moving-picture-contests</a> I also care about:
Sustainability,
Philosophy,
Technology. 

The world is supposed to be getting better, and it isn't, and there is nothing most people can do about it.
