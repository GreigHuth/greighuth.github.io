<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHO ARE YOU?</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><i>not</i> a graphic designer</h5>

<p style="clear:left;"> 
I am Greig, or Gurg, and this is my website.
I studied Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh, and after being dissatisfied with almost every job Ive had, Ive decided to focus on being happy rather than being
"successful". I am many things but mostly I am someone who likes video games and wants to make video games. 

I enjoy games from literally <i>all</i> gaming genres, but i mostly play: 3rd Person "find and fight" games, platformers', Non-Western RPGs and fighting games.
</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY DO?</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><i>Complain, but i try to make it worthwhile</i> </h5>
<p>
    NOW, im working on a game with some friends, its a 1v1 2d fighting game based on Guilty Gear and Darkstalkers, WATCH THIS SPACE
</p>


<p>
But in the past I've worked as: 

    
An admin assistant at a law firm, 
a kitchen porter in a busy and toxic high street restaurant, 
as the only technically competent individual in a growing e-commerce startup,
and as a university tutor. My most recent job has been doing System Administration @ <a href="https://smartr.ai"> smartR.ai</a>.
This work has included an assortment of jobs ranging from: tech support, buying company hardware, containerizing and deploying essential company services and cleaning up messes.
</p>

<p>
As previously mentioned I want to make video games.
Ive been slowly but surely developing my skills ranging from 3D modelling and modding to gameplay system and graphics programming
and gained some experience with a few SDKs and engines (Pico-8, Playdate SDK, Unity) but its hard to maintain momentum. My progress is taking time but thats 
    fine because im not in a rush.
Making a good game in my opinion means involves playing, watching, analysing and experimenting with a lot of video games. I don't play them for fun, i try to understand why im having fun.
I take time to think about why im enjoying what im doing right now, and often have more fun discussing the game then actually playing it.
To that end, I love playing crap games, my growing PS1 collection is at least 60% pure rubbish.
If it interests you, here's an  <a href="/everygameiveplayed.txt"> incomplete list of every game ive played an hour of</a>.


<p>
   The following are a selection of my favourite video games:
    <ul class="no-bullets">

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUT WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FORRRRR?</h2>
<p>
As well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw">interactive-moving-picture-contests</a> I also care about:
Sustainability,
Philosophy,
Technology. 

When im not playing games or complaining, i like to take my telescope out stargazing, when the weather is good for it.
